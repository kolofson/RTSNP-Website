<h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
<pre>

Rolling Thunder was established in November 1998. We are a non - profit organization
  set up for mainstream athletes who are developmentally disabled or have other special
  needs. We are  a running and walking club set up specifically for these athletes.
  We stress important values; such as <strong> Courage, Honesty, Integrity, Responsibility,
  Persistence, and Loyalty.</strong> These are all qualities that are needed to be successful
  in life. Our goals are simple; <strong>Inclusion, Independence, and Choice.</strong> Through running,
  we hope to build up the athletes confidence and self - esteem. This will enable them
  to become more independent in their everyday lives and improve the quality of their lives.
  We achieve this through participation in mainstream running and walking events. We are the
  first club set up for these purposes in mind. We are members of USA Track & Field. There
   is no charge to our athletes. The organization covers athletes expenses from shoes and
   clothing to race entries, association memberships, transportation, and anything else
   required for their participation in these events.</pre>
